# 1989-6-4
I use this as the name of my first repository to remind me of the importance of fight and reason.
From curiosity to reason,the meaning of this serious event changes as time goes by.At first,the name just flashes,then more details but not complete,till last night I have a good knowledge of this event by watching a video.
Of course we can't deny the fact that the demonstration is not mature even funny,but the trial and spirit of these people do touch me a lot.I doubt whether I or we students still have such courage.
These're my feelings,but I don't know whether I'll change event a little bit or not after a couple of days.So I want to memory these thus this way.
